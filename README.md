## ü§ñAuto

- **Decisive Autonomous Framework** with custom auto-follower, allowing robots to ‚Äúreact to its surroundings‚Äù.
- **Multiple Path-Planning Tools Selectable**, including https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner, https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Choreo and https://github.com/team6036/peninsulaportal

## üìùLogging

Built Upon Advantage Kit, everything is logged and recorded for after-match analysis

[GitHub - Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit: Monorepo for robot framework and tools](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit)

## üëÅÔ∏èVision

[GitHub - Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/FRC-Phantom-Vision: a rapid, powerful, easy-to-use and open-source vision framework for FRC](https://github.com/Shenzhen-Robotics-Alliance/FRC-Phantom-Vision)

- **April-tag Robot Localization** Custom filtering mechanism and odometry calibration algorithm, also compatible with photon-vision.
- **Auto Alignment** command, set-to-go!
- **360¬∞ Game-Piece Detection** running on Jetson-Orin-Nano coprocessor.

## üë≠Digital-Twin

A complete match simulation, with physics, score-count, human-players and even opponent robots.

- **Uses Actual Robot Code** in the simulator. This means that you can tune Auto-Stages, PIDs, Auto-Scoring functions and more.  The simulator display robots through https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope.
- **Swerve-Drive Physics Simulation**, fine-tuned with experimental data measured in our training field, as well as real-life data gathered from real competitions this year.
